# *Prosthetic Hand*
# *Timeline:* February 2023 - April 2023

## Project Overview  
In my **2nd semester**, I got really interested in **robots, automation, and sensors**.
This fascination led me to develop a **prosthetic hand** for physically disabled individuals. To achieve this, I explored **microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators** in order to better understand the relationship among them.  After conducting extensive research, I determined the components needed to build this project.
